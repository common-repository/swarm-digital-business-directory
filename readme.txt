Create your own business directory with Google Maps. Create categories with your own icons. Google maps v3 api key required. Easy to use shortcodes.

== Description ==

This is a simple, small and easy to use google maps plugin. Oh did I mention it is FREE! All you need is an API Key which you can learn on how to get here: http://www.w3schools.com/googleAPI.

You can add the main map on any page with this shortcode: [location_map]

To display a plain list of locations, you can use this: [location_list]

You can change the title with the attibute "title" [location_list title="This is my own title"]

By default all the categories will be listed, but if you only want to display one or two categories you can do it like this [location_list categories="Category 1, Category 2"]

By default the actual post title will be listed, but if you want to list the categories you can do it with this [location_list show="categories"]

Please note: If you create a parent category, the child category will inherit the icon, but you have the ability to add icons to child categories as well. Awesome ain't it?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Location not showing on the map? =

- Does the location have a category?
- Does the category have an icon?

If the location is still not showing on the map, it means the details you used may not be the correct format or google doesn't know what you are talking about. To test your address details, go to maps.google.com and see if google can pick it up.
